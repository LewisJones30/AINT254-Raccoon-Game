Please read this before starting the game:
Pushing the enemies will cause them to look like they are sliding. This is a known bug that I have. The enemies will still pathfind correctly, but try not to hit into them!
You will experience a few problems with the pathfinding. Please inform me of these problems in google forms.
I am aware it is the same sprite for the enemies. This will be changed before the final release.
