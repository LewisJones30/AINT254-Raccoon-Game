Bugs with game:
When colliding with burgers, sometimes some unexpected things may happen; You may receive more points than expected.
The player will also bounce, which is not an intended effect either.
With the double speed powerup, try not to hit a burger too hard or you may fly off the screen.
The particles are not working correctly on the powerups that spawn, and are static within the game.
I plan to add working randomness when the objects are spawned. This sort of works but not 100%.
