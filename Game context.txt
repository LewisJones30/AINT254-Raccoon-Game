Raccoon game context:
You play as Ciri, a raccoon who is hungry for food in the back streets of a city.
You have discovered that there are dumpsters around the back streets containing food, that occasionally leaks onto the floor.
However, you aren't the only one and you must survive.
The other raccoons aren't friendly and will attack you if you go near them. They are defending the dumpsters as it is their source of food.
In 3 days time, you will have enough energy to leave the city.
Can you survive?
